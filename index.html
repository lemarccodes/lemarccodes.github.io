                                <p>Lemarc Deneal September, born in Riversdale, Western Cape, South Africa is a full-time BCom student at Stellenbosch University.  
                                    From a government school to an <em>A.C.E school</em>, September has navigated his way through very different schooling systems and managed to matriculate with five distinctions.  
                                </p>
                                <p>Apart from academics, September has always had a keen interest in music and started developing his own music from the age of seven.  
                                    At the age of 17, September debuted one of his original songs on Expresso, a South African morning show on national television.  
                                    Being as ambitious and goal driven as he is, September is still mastering his art whilst in pursuit of his bachelorâ€™s degree.
